# From 0 to glTF with WebGPU Code 

This repo contains the code for each post in my "From 0 to glTF with WebGPU"
blog series. These repos all use my [webgpu-webpack](https://github.com/Twinklebear/webgpu-webpack-starter)
To run an example from its subdirectory you can simply run `npm install` followed by `npm run serve`. Then
open Chrome Beta/Canary (or stable once 113 is out) and point it at `localhost:8080`.
